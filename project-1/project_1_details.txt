PROJECT 1

Subject: Business Analytics Project on Predictive Modeling for Customer Churn


Problem Description:
Task is to develop a predictive model to identify the likelihood of customer churn for a business or service. This involves analyzing customer data, identifying key predictors of churn, and building a model that can forecast potential customer attrition.

Steps to Follow for Model Development:
Data Collection and Preparation:
Gather historical customer data which may include demographics, purchase history, service usage patterns, customer service interactions, and any other relevant data.

Clean and preprocess the data for analysis, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conduct an initial analysis to understand the data’s characteristics and identify patterns and trends.

Use visualizations to uncover insights and relationships between variables.

Feature Selection and Engineering:
Identify which features are most predictive of customer churn.
Consider creating new features that might improve the model's performance.

Model Selection:
Choose appropriate predictive modeling techniques (like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks) based on the data and the problem’s nature.
Experiment with different models to determine which performs best.

Model Training and Validation:
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the model on the training set and validate its performance on the test set using appropriate metrics (like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

Model Evaluation and Tuning:
Evaluate the model’s performance and adjust parameters as needed to improve accuracy.
Use techniques like cross-validation for more robust model evaluation.
Interpretation of Results and Insights:
Analyze the model’s findings to draw meaningful insights about customer churn.
Identify key factors contributing to churn and suggest potential strategies to retain customers.

Report and Presentation:
Prepare a comprehensive report detailing your methodology, findings, and business insights.
Develop a presentation to communicate the results to stakeholders, focusing on actionable recommendations.

Step 1 :
We will begin with collecting data from Kaggle.
The name of the source file is WA_Fm-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv
Then we install the required libraries to start buildign our model
