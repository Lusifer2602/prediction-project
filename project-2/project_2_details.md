# PROJECT 2

## Subject: Financial Forecasting with Time Series Analysis Project

## Problem Description:
Your task is to conduct a time series analysis for financial forecasting. This involves selecting a financial metric (such as stock prices, exchange rates, sales revenue, etc.) and using historical data to forecast future values. The goal is to provide accurate and insightful forecasts that can aid in financial planning and strategy.


## Steps to Follow for Analysis and Forecasting:

### Data Selection:
Choose a financial metric to forecast. This could be the stock price of a company, currency exchange rates, sales figures, etc.
Collect historical data for the metric, ensuring that the data is as complete and reliable as possible.

### Data Preparation:
Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for analysis. This may include handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming data if necessary.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Perform an initial analysis to understand the dataâ€™s characteristics. Look for patterns, trends, seasonality, and any other relevant features in the data.

### Model Selection:
Choose appropriate time series models such as ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA), Exponential Smoothing, or advanced machine learning models.
Consider the unique aspects of your data when selecting the model.

### Model Training and Validation:
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train your model on the training set and validate its performance on the test set using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or others relevant to your data.

### Forecasting:
Use the model to forecast future values of the financial metric.
Analyze the forecast results and assess their potential impact on financial planning and decision-making.

### Report and Presentation:
Prepare a detailed report that includes your methodology, analysis, model choice, and forecast results.
Develop a presentation that summarizes your findings, providing clear visuals and forecasts.
